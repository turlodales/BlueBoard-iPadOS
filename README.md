# BlueBoard-iPadOS

Hello and Welcome This is my own attempted to get it reworking but as 32bit Devices are not supported by apple plz see the links below for 32bit and some 64bit devices will work and as Apple has made iPadOS this will just be iPad's only .

32bit Devices Plz use BlueBoard version https://github.com/turlodales/BlueBoard (iPhone's, iPod's, iPads before ios 13)
64bit Devices Plz use BlueBoard 2 version https://github.com/turlodales/BlueBoard-2 (iPhone's, iPod's, iPads before ios 13)

im not sure how different iPadOS will be from iOS untill a iOS/iPadOS JailBreak comes out 

This is my own attempted to get reworking my layout is taken form another tweak i have been working so i will be neating this up later just trying to make it looking better for my own mind

My own plan is to make it work from see below

- [x] iPadOS 13.0

my plain is to make a working verson of BlueBoard for ios 13.0 to 13.X.X

why am i putting is on github:

for one resaon only extra backup i have the project on my mac mini, my own freenas server, and github so if any one of them gets cruppted i have backup saved.

My own road map
- [x] Step 1 = Get read me finished 
- [x] Step 2 = Start working on the tweak
- [ ] Step 3 = Get it working on My Own Devices
- [ ] Step 4 = Get New Devices or ask for Beta Testers
- [ ] Step 5 = Fix bugs 
- [ ] Step 6 = Relise to the public
- [ ] Step 8 = Update when needed

things i want to add
- [ ] 1 = more colours  
- [ ] 2 = change the colour of the text

I would like to say a big thank you to the people that have helped me make this happen:

xtm3x the person that makes this tweak in the first place

myself to prove that even someone like me with dyslexia can do something to help the jailbreaking community

FreeNAS OS for my Home Server's

GitHub of making me able to host it on here

Youtube for the vid's that have helped me do this I will list them all soon more to follow when I have spoken to them if I can post they vids

more to follow if I get help

In case anyone is wondering I started using jailbroken devices from the iPhone original 2G,3GS,4S,5S,6S+,8+ I do like the S models. I only have 2 iPads Air 2 and Pro 12.9. I have the Apple TV 3 and 4 sadly both not jailbroken yet and I have the Apple Watch 1st gen. I now have the 5C I got of eBay on 10.3.3 sadly I don't have any of the SHSH2 blobs saved I just want to help put something back into the community.
